## Homemade Mashed Potatoes

*Servings:* 4

#### Ingredients

- 2 lb yukon gold potato
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 8 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed, cold
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- chive, finely chopped, for serving

#### Instructions

1. On a cutting board, peel the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl of cold water after peeling to avoid discoloration.
2. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2 cm) cubes.
3. Add the potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes.
4. In a small saucepan, bring the milk, heavy cream, and garlic to a simmer over low heat.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve.
6. Drain the potatoes in a colander and transfer back to the pot.
7. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, potato ricer, or by pushing through a fine mesh sieve with a spatula.
8. Add the cubed cold butter and salt. Stir to combine.
9. Gradually add the cream mixture to the potatoes, little by little, until fully incorporated.
