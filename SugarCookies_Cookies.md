## Soft Sugar Cookies


#### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 cup (2 sticks) SALTED butter, softened
- 1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar, for rolling

#### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
2. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a medium size bowl. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, using an electric or stand mixer, cream together the butter, and granulated sugar until combined.
4. Add egg yolks and vanilla extract.
5. Add flour mixture and mix until just combined. DO NOT OVERMIX!
6. Using a cookie scoop or ice cream scoop, scoop dough into balls about 2 Tablespoons each, roll in sugar and place onto prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until tops of cookies start to crack. Let cool for 5 minutes on baking sheet before moving them to a wire rack. Let cool completely on wire rack.

#### Notes
- STORE: Cookies will stay fresh for up to 7 days in an airtight container, stored at room temperature.
- FREEZING: Roll the dough into balls and place them in an airtight container. You can freeze the cookie dough for up to 2 months. To bake, place frozen cookie dough balls onto prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
- ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR: It’s super important to measure the flour correctly. Too much or too little flour can change the consistency of the cookie.
- BAKING SODA: Make sure your baking soda is no more than 3 months old. If your using old baking soda, the cookies won’t rise properly and will be FLAT.
- BAKING POWDER: Make sure your baking powder is not too old or your cookies will come out FLAT and spread!
- SALTED BUTTER: If you don’t have salted butter, I would add about 1/2-1 teaspoon of salt. Also, make sure your butter is at room temperature. If your butter is TOO WARM, it will also result in cookies that will SPREAD. So the best thing to do is let the butter sit out on the counter for at least 1 hour before you start baking and it will be perfect!
- EGG YOLKS: It’s very important that you separate the egg yolks, this recipe will NOT turn out if you use 3 whole eggs.
