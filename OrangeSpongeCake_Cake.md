**Serves:** 8 persons

#### Ingredients

### For the pan:
- 2 tps. butter
- 2 TBS.granulated sugar

### For the batter:
- 1/2 cup plus 1 TBS. (120 grams) unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup plus 2 TBS. (120 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 organic orange (about 200g/7oz), carefully washed
- 1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1 TBS. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. salt

### For the glaze:
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 tsp. orange zest

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. First, prepare the pan. Butter the bottom and sides of a 22-to-25-cm (9-to-10-inch) round cake pan with the 2 teaspoons butter. Sprinkle with the 2 tablespoons sugar, then shake and tilt and swoosh the pan around to coat. 
3. Next up, make the batter. Cream together the butter and sugar. Crack in the eggs one by one and mix until thoroughly combined.
4. Grate the zest from the entire orange over the bowl. Juice the orange and add 125 ml (1/2 cup) of the juice to the batter. Mix until smooth.
5. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold the flour mixture into the batter and mix until just combined.
6. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size pan you used, until the cake is golden brown and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.
7. Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes (no more, or the caramel on the crust will harden and stick to the pan), then flip onto a serving plate. 
8. In a pot, combine ingredients for glaze and stir for 5 mins on low heat.
9. Pour glaze onto cake.
