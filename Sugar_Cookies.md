## Soft Sugar Cookies

**Serving:** 15 Cookies

#### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened to cool room temp (see note)
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract optional
- 3/4 cup sprinkles

#### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
3. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat butter until smooth. Slowly pour in the sugar, mixing as you pour. Beat sugar and butter for a minute, until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, mixing until combined and scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add 1/2 cup sprinkles and stir by hand until combined.
4. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball (or use a 1 1/2 tablespoon scoop). Place 1/4 cup sprinkles on a plate and press the tops of the dough balls in additional sprinkles (optional). Place dough balls onto prepared baking sheet leaving about an inch for spreading. 
5. **Bake for 8-10 minutes**. The edges should be completely set, and the centers should look slightly under cooked, they will finish cooking while cooling on the baking sheet.
6. Place the baking sheets on wire racks to cool. Repeat with remaining dough once the baking sheets are completely cool.

#### Notes
Butter should be softened slightly. It should not be starting to melt, or losing its shape.
