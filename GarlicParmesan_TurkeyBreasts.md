## Garlic Parmesan Turkey Breast Cutlets

*Servings:* 4 people

#### Ingredients

- 1 lb  turkey breast cutlets
- 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons olive oil

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. In a shallow dish or plate, whisk together the bread crumbs, parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and parsley. Dredge the turkey cutlets in the mixture, patting gently to coat both sides.
3. Place the cutlets in the hot skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. 
4. Move the browned cutlets to a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven. Bake 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.

#### Notes

- Preheat the skillet before you start to brown the cutlets.  If it’s not hot when you put them in, you’ll cook the turkey more than it should before going in the oven.
- Use a meat thermometer to make sure the turkey is at least 165 degrees F
- Heat the olive oil in a large sauce pan before adding in the cutlets.
